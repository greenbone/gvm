# About Greenbone Vulnerability Manager

The Greenbone Vulnerability Manager is the central management service between
security scanners and the user clients.

It manages the storage of any vulnerability management configurations and of the
scan results. Access to data, control commands and workflows is offered via the
XML-based Greenbone Management Protocol (GMP). The primary scanner
*[OpenVAS Scanner](https://github.com/greenbone/openvas-scanner)*
is controlled directly via protocol OTP while any other remote scanner is coupled
with the Open Scanner Protocol (OSP).
